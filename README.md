**Global Water Consumption Analysis**

Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of global water consumption using a dataset that includes various water consumption statistics across countries. The analysis focuses on understanding the water usage in different sectors (agriculture, industry, and household), examining trends in rainfall, and investigating groundwater depletion over time. Additionally, it provides insights on water consumption patterns across different continents.
